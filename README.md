# Algorithms
### Tomoya Tokunaga (mailto: ttokunag@ucsd.edu)

This repository contains all the files about Algorithms which is from very well-known ones such as Binary Search and Merge Sort to ones not so well-known but I think useful through development. I would like you to let me know if there exists some issues or room for implovement on my codes!

The followings are subdirectories this repository contains and short descriptions on them:
### Time Complexity Comparison
This IPython notebook is about the experiment of timing performances of well-known sorting algorithms such as Insertion sort, Heap sort, Merge sort, and Quick sort. I was so curious about why algorithms performances differ even though their Big O notations are the same that I do this experiment.

I timed every algorithm performance and create a dataframe using `pandas` python library, and at the end I visualized the performance difference by plotting the data on a graph. The followings are the actual graphs I've created in the notebook.<br>

I made analysis from my viewpoint, so I would be happy if you read the notebook if you get interested in by accident. I'm look forward to your feedbacks!

### Graph related algorithms
This repository contains files about graph related algorithms such as path-finding between two points using BFS and DFS, or shortest path calculation with Dijkstra's algorithm.

### Sorting Algorithms
contains files which are about the sorting algorithms such as Merge Sort, Quick Sort, Heap sort, and so on.
I plotted a graph of time complexity of each algorithms using Jupyter Notebook.

### Binary Search
is about algorithms around Binary search.
