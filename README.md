# Algorithms
### Tomoya Tokunaga (mailto: ttokunag@ucsd.edu)

This repository contains all the files about Algorithms which is from very well-known ones such as Binary Search and Merge Sort to ones not so well-known but I think useful through development. I would like you to let me know if there exists some issues or room for implovement on my codes!

The followings are subdirectories this repository contains and short descriptions on them:
### Graph related algorithms
This repository contains files about graph topics like path finding.

### Sorting Algorithms
contains files which are about the sorting algorithms such as Merge Sort, Quick Sort, etc..

### Binary Search
is about algorithms around Binary search.
