# Binary Search
### Tomoya Tokunaga (mailto: ttokunag@ucsd.edu)

This repository is all about binary search.
I implemented a very basic binary search algorithm in Python and Java codes.
I also implemented a binary insertion sort, which may be used when we want to insert and sort elements at the same time without linear search.

### Binary Search 
Complexity: ***O(log(N))*** time | ***O(1)*** space

### Binary Search insertion
Complexity: ***O(N + log(N))*** time | ***O(1)*** space
- Binary search takes *O(log(N))* time, and insertion takes *O(N)*. Hence *O(N)+O(log(N)) = O(N + log(N))*
- This way is faster than the linear search method which takes *O(N)+O(N) = O(2N)* time
