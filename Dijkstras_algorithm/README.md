# Dijkstra's Algorithm
### Tomoya Tokunaga(mailto: ttokunag@ucsd.edu)

This repository contains files about [Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dijkstra%27s_algorithm). There're several way to implement the algorithm. One uses an array data structure in order to store unvisited nodes while others use a binary heap or Fibonacci heap data structure.<br><br> In here, I implemented Dijkstra's alogrithm using an `array` and a `binary min-heap`.

### Algorithm Description
Dijkstra's algorithm is a sort of greediness algorithm introduced by Dutch computer scientist, Edsger W. Dijkstra.
