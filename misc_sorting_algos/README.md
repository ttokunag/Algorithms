# Sorting Algorithms
### Tomoya Tokunaga (mailto: ttokunag@ucsd.edu)

This repository consists of 2 components: Algorithm part and Comparator part
### Comparator
This component contains all rules about how we compare 2 elements, namely, which come before and after.
The followings are all comparators used for the sorting algorithms
- Integers (usual integer comparison)
- Strings (Lexicographical order)
- Reverse Strings (Lexicographical order of reversed String)
- Student (based on students' ID and cumulative GPA)

### Algorithms
This component contains well-known sorting algorithms.
The followings are their name and average complexity
- **Bubble sort**: O(N^2) time | O(1) space
- **Selection sort**: O(N^2) time | O(1) space
- **Merge Sort**: O(Nlog(N)) time | O(N) space
- **Count sort**: O(N) time | O(N) space
