# Path Finding Algorithm
### Tomoya Tokunaga(mailto: ttokunag@ucsd.edu)

This repository contains a file about my analysis on Breadth-First Search(BFS) and Depth-First Search(DFS) to find
a path existence of two points in graph data structures. I started off with implementing the algorithms and time their
performance, then plot the data on a graph to visually explain the difference of performances.

The following is a visualization I made in a notebook:<br><br>

<br>This graph show the performances of two algorithms with different sizes of graph data structures.
