# Binary Search
### Tomoya Tokunaga (mailto: ttokunag@ucsd.edu)

This repository is all about binary search.
I implemented a very basic binary search algorithm in Python and Java codes.
I also implemented a binary insertion sort, which may be used when we want to insert and sort elements at the same time without linear search.
