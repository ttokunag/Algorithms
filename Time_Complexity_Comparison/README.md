# Time Complexity Comparison
### Tomoya Tokunaga(mailto: ttokunag@ucsd.edu)
This IPython notebook is about the experiment of timing performances of well-known sorting algorithms such as **Insertion** sort, 
**Heap** sort, **Merge** sort, and **Quick** sort. I was so curious about why algorithms performances differ even though 
their Big O notations are the same that I do this experiment.

I timed every algorithm performance and create a dataframe using `pandas` python library, and at the end I visualized 
the performance difference by plotting the data on a graph. The followings are the actual graphs I've created in the notebook.<br>

I made analysis from my viewpoint, so I would be happy if you read the notebook if you get interested in by accident. 
I'm look forward to your feedbacks!
